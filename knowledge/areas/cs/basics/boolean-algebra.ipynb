    "The science of logic belongs to Ancient Greeks, their rational thinking taught that an expression can be either true, or false. The boolean algebra takes the principles of truthness or falseness of an expression and study statements as well as their relations, but not it's content.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean algebra is appreciated because the computer is built on logical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In boolean algebra the true is 1 and false is 0.  "
