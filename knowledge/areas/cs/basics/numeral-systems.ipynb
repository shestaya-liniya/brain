    "# Numeral systems\n",

    "## Def\n",
    "Numeral system is a system of symbolic representation or encoding of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## History\n",
    "The first numeral system introduced by Egiptions is a [unary numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_numeral_system), in contrast of modern most used num. sys. it does not rely on symbol position. In unary num. sys. each natural number was represented by a coressponding number of symbols. For example if the symbol / is chosen, then the number seven would be represented by ///////.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order of making count related problems easier, the first positional num. sys. was created. It was a 60 based num. sys. created by Babylonians, 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute is nothing else than the babylonian legacy used until these days.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In positional number system the value of a digit is depending of it's position. And each position represents a power of the base and each digit tells how many of those units you have\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bases\n",
    "\n",
    "Base or radix (root from Latin) is a number of unique digits and/or symbols used to represent a number in distinct num. sys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most used are radix 10, 2, 16 and 8. Their usability is defined by practical usage. For example the num. sys. of the base 2 is used in the field of electronics as the computer transistor has only two positions: on of off. Base 10 is very practical to count with human fingers.    "
