# Why shestaya_liniya

<span class="tag">#aboutMe</span>

I was born in Russia and moved in France with my family when I was 12, and my username is kinda related to that. My fullname is Andrei Silin, and one day when I was in my French school, the teacher said: "Now you need to skip six lines on your paper to start the exercice". Suddenly, the whole class turned to me and started laughing. That’s because “six lignes” (six lines) in French is pronounced /si liɲ/ - almost exactly like my last name.

Now, to bring it all together, "shestaya liniya" is a russian transcription of "шестая линия" - which means: _six lines_. So my username is a russian transcription of a sentence which sounds as my last name in french. It's kinda mirorring my cultural duality and I like it.
