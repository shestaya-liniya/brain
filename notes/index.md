<p class="hero-p">
  I have created this <a href="https://vitepress.dev/">space</a> for tracking and saving my knowledge in different fields, especially about dev. If you don't see something in my notes - <span class="accent">probably I don't know that.</span>
</p>
<p class="hero-p">
  This space is open to everyone. So you can <a href="/surf.gif">surf</a> freely here, and if you’d like to contribute, you’re welcome to click “Edit on GitHub” on any page.
