# Why shestaya_liniya

I was born in Russia and moved in France with my family when I was 12, and my username is surprisingly related to that. My full name is Andrei Silin, and one day when I was in my French school, the teacher said: "Now you need to skip six lines on your paper to start the exercice". Suddenly, the whole class turned to me and started laughing. That’s because six lines (fr: _six lignes_) in French is pronounced /si liɲ/ - almost exactly like my last name.

Now, to bring it all together, "shestaya liniya" is the russian transcription of "шестая линия" - which means _sixth line_ in english. So my username is a russian transcription of a sentence which sounds as my last name in french. It represent my cultural duality and has a fun story, cool enough!
